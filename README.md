# Machine-Learning
A repository containing my machine learning projects.

The programming language I will be using is Python, along with many of its libraries.

This repository will hopefully demonstrate my understanding of machine learning. I will do this by providing explanations of what I'm doing at every step, along with implementing the theory into code.
